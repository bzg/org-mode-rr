** Aynschronous babel calls

It should be possible to run C-c C-c on a block and have the babel
call run asynchronously.

** Babel workflow engine

- #+call [block1] [block2] :: call several blocks independantly.  Each
     block can be called asynchronously since its side-effects are not
     relevant for running the other code blocks.

- #+run [block1] [block2] :: run [block1] and [block2] *sequentially*.
     The whole call to #+run can run asynchronously, but all blocks
     will be called in sequential order and the n block needs to
     finish before n+1 can start.

- #+map [block] [&rest] :: would map block over a list of data.  We
     still need to define the format for the "list of data".  The
     whole call to #+map could run asynchronously.

- #+thread [data] [block1] [block2] :: call block1 with data, then
     block2 with the output from block1, etc.  (Note that this is
     similar to -> and ->> in Clojure, but we don't distinguish the
     two as there is no argument order in babel blocks.)

** Babel workflow browser

The same way that C-c ' on #+TBLFM lines allows to browse the formula
and see the corresponding references, C-c ' on #+call/map/run would
allow to see the corresponding blocks.

** Signature and typing?

- Code blocks could describe the types of data they accept, and the
  type of data they emit.

- An option would make it possible to type-check the data before they
  are processed.

- If the Babel browser, we could display the signatures as well.

** Consistent handling of stderr

For now stderr cannot always be captured in Org buffers, it depends on
the backend implementation.

*** Some ideas for what this would look like

By default, we should integrate stdout and stderr in #+RESULTS for
backward compatibility. It could look like for an example with no
stderr like this (the same as it did before):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+RESULTS:
: 5
#+END_EXAMPLE

If there is output on stderr, we might see

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+RESULTS:
: 5

stderr: 
Some kind of message
#+END_EXAMPLE

It might be possible to have a header to split the messages,
e.g. :results output :stderr. The stderr could be fontified, e.g. in
red to draw attention.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+RESULTS:
: 5

#+STDERR:
Some error message
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Org /ad hoc/ tools

** Create a set of better "<" templates

For example: 

<R for

#+BEGIN_SRC R [FIXME: see Arnaud's example]
#+END_SRC

Here are a few of the ones I (JRK) use:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; add <p for python expansion
(add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist
             '("p" "#+BEGIN_SRC python\n?\n#+END_SRC" "<src lang=\"python\">\n?\n</src>"))

;; add <por for python expansion with raw output
(add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist
             '("por" "#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output raw\n?\n#+END_SRC" "<src lang=\"python\">\n?\n</src>"))

;; add <pv for python expansion with value
(add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist
             '("pv" "#+BEGIN_SRC python :results value\n?\n#+END_SRC" "<src lang=\"python\">\n?\n</src>"))

;; add <el for emacs-lisp expansion
(add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist
             '("el" "#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp\n?\n#+END_SRC" "<src lang=\"emacs-lisp\">\n?\n</src>"))

;; add <sh for shell
(add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist
             '("sh" "#+BEGIN_SRC sh\n?\n#+END_SRC" "<src lang=\"shell\">\n?\n</src>"))
#+END_SRC

* General Emacs tools

- An emacs starter kit for experimental computer scientist?

This is a tricky one, although it is the purpose of my jmax starter kit: http://github.com/jkitchin/jmax. I use it with my students for teaching and research. It is not as polished as prelude or the emacs24-starter-kit, but configures org the way I use it, and provides a lot of functionality I like, particularly for scientific publishing and analysis. It is self-contained, even including precompiled emacs for windows. 

- Maybe hosting a list of VM with predefined configurations?

* Generic external tools

- Explore Org-mode parser and whether they let anyone use Org Babel
  outside of Emacs.
